# A Brief Panel Data Analysis to Forecast U.S. Presidential Election

  In this paper I will initially retrace the path marked by Ray C. Fair
  with his long lasting series of presidential elections forecasts
  exploiting the same variables he uses but enriching the model with
  panel data. Exploiting the Fixed Effects estimation I will then add
  new variables that, according to our intuition, could lead to an
  overall improvement of the model and test for them applying the LASSO
  algorithm for model selection. I will finally infer the results and
  explore the possible challenges in disentangling causality from
  correlation.
